Hygiene and cleanliness is maintained by the staff and the owner is behaving very friendly. Whenever i have plan to eating Kadhai Paneer and Stuffed Naan, i love to go Aman Di Punjabi Rasoi. They serve best of North-Indian Food at the reasonable price. The pricing is neither low or much high, prices are reasonable that everyone can digest. I recommend you to visit here once and have your desirable dishes."
